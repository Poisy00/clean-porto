# POISY — Product Overview

## Summary

POISY is a high-end digital design house specializing in "living systems"—interfaces that breathe, dashboards that pulse with real-time data, and commerce experiences with tactile weight. We bridge engineering rigor with visceral intuition, turning passive users into active operators.

## Planned Sections

1. **Hero** — The breathing entrance that establishes POISY as a design house—minimal, luminous, with a single high-intent CTA floating in the void.
2. **Arsenal** — The curated gallery of six signature projects, each presented as a floating jewel with prismatic hover states and weightless lifts.
3. **Philosophy** — The "Tactile Etherealism" manifesto and Full-Stack Systems Architect positioning—who POISY is and why the work feels different.
4. **Consultation** — The high-ticket booking flow that filters for serious inquiries and converts quality over quantity.
